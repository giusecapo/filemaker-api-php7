# File Maker API for PHP7

Since FileMaker PHP APIs have several compatibility issues with latest PHP versions, I readapted the library to work with PHP 7.1.13 (I'm using php-osx).

Just copy-paste these files into your project replacing the old library (if you had one).

Then include in your project:

```php
require_once("path/to/FileMaker.php")
```

Hope you enjoy!
